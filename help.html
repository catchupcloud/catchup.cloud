          <h3>Getting Started</h3><p>
          
          Inviting team members to your organization: 
          The Admins of the organization can create an organization account on CatchUp and invite team members to join the organization. 
          <br><br>
          Once you get an invitation email from the Admin, simply sign in to your dashboard using the given details. Upon login, update your profile with your details and change your password. 
          
          <br><br>
          You will be able to see the Projects you are part of. 
          <br><br>
          The interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. 
          
          
          </p><h3>Create Projects</h3><p>
          
          Easily create and manage projects in the Projects tab: 
          To add a project, click on Add Project button and add relevant project description, assigning the manager, team members, contractors and clients. You can also add these later. 
          <br><br>
          The Project Overview tab shows all the basics of the project, from tasks, recent activities, Manager, Client, etc., to its description and the team (click the “Show More” button to view this information). The overview page also shows the Recent Activities pertaining to this project as a chronological log, so that you can easily keep track of all events along the timeline.

        </p><h3>Add People</h3><p>
          
          The Admins of the project can add team members to the project. They can also add contractors and clients to the project. 
          <br><br>
          All team members can see the people added to the project in the People tab.
          
          <center><video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/AddPeople.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

        </p><h3>Create Tasks</h3><p>
          
          A project may last months or even a year or more. A project is broken down into smaller chunks of work known as tasks that may take a month or a couple of months for closure. Tasks are like project modeules and help provide context in the form of work to drive the project to completion.
          <br><br>
          Easily create tasks by clicking the Add Task button and filling in the relevant details. You can assign the task to a specific team member and set timlines - start/end dates for the same. 
          
          <center><video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/CreateTasks.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
          
        </p><h3>Task Kanban</h3><p>
          
          This tab shows the status of all tasks of that project. You can directly change status of any task by a simple drag-drop or edit the task to update details or timelines. 
          <br><br>
          This tab gives a view of the status of all tasks in a glance, along with the capability to update the same by clicking the edit button given for each task. You can also directly go into a specific task tab by clicking on the “view” button provided on each task. 
          <center>
          <video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/TaskKanban.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>


        </p><h3>Create Action Items</h3><p>
          
          Tasks can be further divided in to actionable work items and assigned to specific team members to work on. These work allocations may typically range between a few days to about a week or two. 
          <br><br>
          Simply click the Add Action Item button to create an action item under a task. Add the specific details like description, start and end dates and assign to a team member.  

          <center><video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/CreateActionItems.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

          <br><br>
          <h3>Unified Communication & Instant Messaging/Chat</h3>
          
          No need for any third-party apps or tools to collaborate and communicate with the team. CatchUp comes with a communication interface built right in that helps you connect with the team in real time and share project files and documents to work together.
          <br><br>
          Context makes conversations meaningful! So, CatchUp provides a communication interface at 3 levels - 
          

        </p><h3>Task Chat & Task Files</h3><p>
          Setting the context to a particular task , the task chat and task files are used to communicate and share information with the team on that task in real time. It is a chat space where you can provide immediate feedback, ask questions, request updates for tasks and add attachments for the team. You can even mention team members for updates and queries and they will get dedicated notification in their Mentions tab.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, the final outcome of the Task should be recorded as a Task Result in that tab. The result can be in the form of closure comments and/or a relevant document.
          
          <center><video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/TaskChat_and_Files.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>


        </p><h3>Action Item Chat & Action Item Files</h3><p>
          This works just like the task chat & task files, with the cotnext of a specific Action Item. You can do all Action Item communication and information/file sharing through this. 
          <br><br>
          Additionally, the final outcome of the Action Item should be recorded as an Action Item Result in that tab. The result can be in the form of closure comments and/or a relevant document.
          <center>
          <video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/ActionItemChat_and_Files.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
          
        </p><h3>Org Chat</h3><p>
          Not to forget those one-on-one’s! Yes, you can chat in real-time directly with any team member through the Org Chat. 
          
          <center><video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/OrgChat.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

        </p><h3>Document Management</h3><p>
          
          CatchUp boasts of an enterprise grade document management system to create, share and collaborate on documents in real time. CatchUp comes with an integrated MS office Suite so you don’t need spearate subscriptions of the same to prepare your documents. Just click on New Document or Upload an exsiting one and you and your team can collaborate over the docs. So be it a word document, a presentation or a spreadsheet, you have it all there. 
          <br><br>
          Furthermore, as the project is already divided into tasks, these documents are available at the task level, so that you don’t have to keep searching for them in different folders on your system. The documents never lose context!
          <br><br>
          But still, if you’re searching for a document you’re not sure of, simply use the Search tab to locate it.
          <center>

        </p><h3>Meetings</h3><p>
          
          Working in teams means meetings! All your meeting and video conference needs come right out of the box in CatchUp so you don’t need any other third-party subscriptions or unsecure tools to hold meetings and calls. 
          <br><br>
          Moreover, meetings must be held with context, and CatchUp takes care of that! Hence, the Meetings tab is available under each task, to set the context even before a meeting is setup. 
          <br><br>
          Click the New Meeting button to setup a meeting with your team. You can invite specific team members to the meeting, or anyone following the task can also join in.

        </p><h3>Calendar</h3><p>
          
          Of course, no project runs without timelines! The project is divided into work items called tasks, which have their respective start and end dates. The calendar gives a complete view of all tasks with their timelines, so you never miss a deadline again!
          
          <center>
          <video autoplay muted loop id="myVideo" style="max-width:80%; width: 80%;" poster="images/screenshots/1.png" src="images/screenshots/calendar.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>


        </p><h3>Wiki</h3><p>
          
          You can share knowledge and unleash collective intelligence required for your project in this section. The Project Wiki is a space to have all important project docs, the team must have access to, to get started and achieve the project goals, at one place. 
          <br><br>  
          It helps to share knowledge at the project level, keep everyone in sync of the project goals, and helps quicken the onboarding process of a new team member to the project.
