Information security has become increasingly important in an increasingly digital society. Organizations worldwide are navigating the hash landscape of data breaches, cyber threats, and regulatory responsibilities to safeguard sensitive information.

ISO 27001 has emerged as a beacon of trust and reliability in this growing digital economy. The most recent version of the international standard for information security management is ISO 27001:2022, an upgrade from ISO 27001:2013. It gives organizations a structure for managing and protecting their information assets. The foundation of this standard is the risk management principle, which requires organizations to identify, evaluate, and address information security risks.
